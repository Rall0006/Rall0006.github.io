            <hr>
            <p>
               I am currently enrolled in Interactive media design at Algonquin college. This is my 3<sup>rd</sup> college program. I have recently completed the Algonquin online certificate in Social media management. I was previously in the Video game art and design course at Durham college. I hope to use this varied set of skills to create a new approach to social media management in the entertainment industry. I specifically want to work in the South Korean entertainment industry. I believe using my abilities to make various forms of media will help with the trend of entertainment companies making exclusive apps for fans of their artists.

               I have always enjoyed both art and technology and want to have a career where I can combine these two disciplines. I have enjoyed drawing and painting and photography ever since I was a child. I began to learn how to make interactive forms of media in highschool like making stickers and flash animations. I pursued this interest into my post secondary education where I learned the possibilities of digital art.
