            <p>
               I am currently enrolled in Interactive media design at Algonquin college. I have recently completed the Algonquin online certificate in Social media management. I was previously in the Video game art and design course at Durham college. I hope to use this varied set of skills to create a new approach to social media management in the entertainment industry. I specifically want to work in the South Korean entertainment industry. I believe using my abilities to make various forms of media will help with the trend of entertainment companies making exclusive apps for fans of their artists.
