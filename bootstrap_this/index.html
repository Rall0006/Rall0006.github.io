    <h1 class="display-1 text-center">Let's talk about Bootstrap (no, not the pirate)</h1>

   <p class="text-center">
     Bootstrap is an exccelent tool for building a website quickly if you know how to use it.
     <br>
     It esentially does a half of the formatting work for you by inserting some refference links into the code that connect to premade css code.
     <br>
     Bootstrap has many wonderful tools and features that make it a good buddy for website coding projects.
     <br>
     let's explore some of them together!
    </p>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-6">
            <h4 class="text-danger"><u>It's mobile first design.</u></h4>
            <p>
              Bootstrap not only allows for but focuses on a mobile first development approach.
              <br>
              It does this by using a 12 column flexbox grid in tandem with 5 different responsive tiers. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-6">
            <h4 class="text-success"><u>It's open source!</u></h4>
            <p>
              It's open source which means it's publically available and free to use.
              <br>
              it's made to help everyone from a beginner who wants to try their hand at making a website or an experinced designer who just wants ahelping hand to save them time.
              <br>
              Use Bootstrap's toolkit for HTML,JS, and CSS to help you confindently build your websites and apps in half the time.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-6">
            <h4 class="text-success"><u>Hansel and Gretel and the code.</u></h4>
            <p>
              Bootstrap includes the wonderful feature of breadcrumbs.
              <br>
              Breadcrumbs allow you to see the page you're working on in relation to the hierachy of the navigation.
              <br>
              This can be very useful for seeing how things are connected when building bigger, more complex websites and apps.
              <br>
              but even seing how small 3 page sites connect together can help a lot.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-6">
            <h4 class="text-danger"><u>Ready, set, start(er template)!</u></h4>
            <p>
              Bootstrap has an easy to use starter template on their website here:
              <br>
              <button class="btn btn-success" onclick="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/">Starter Template</button>
              <br>
              It's can make starting any project significantly easier.
              <br>
              You need to remeber to maintain the placement order of the CSS and JS links.
              <br>
              The CSS link from the template must alsways but the the first CSS and the JS link must always be the absolute last in the page code.
            </p>
          </div>
       </div>
     </div> 
    <p class="text-center">
      Bootstrap can be an easy to use friend to any coder who decides to embrace it.
      <br>
      Just make sure to use it properly, afterall, with great power comes great resposibility.
      <br>
      (That and you don't want break your code.)
    </p>
      
    <h4 class="text-center"> 
      Have fun Bootstrapping!
